<h1>THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Search function only searches homepage titles and content preview, doesn't work on article pages or author names</li>
<li>Need some sort of user account or submission area that automatically creates and adds articles without needing to edit a HTML template every time</li>
<li>login button doesn't changed when logged in / cant log out</li>
<li>Make an article page/template - <b>PONGLE IS DOING THIS</b></li>
<li>footer doesn't show on mobile</li>
<li>website doesn't fit on mobile, goes off screen</li>
</ul>
